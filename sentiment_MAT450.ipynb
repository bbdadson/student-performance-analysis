There is a lot that can be learned from the students and their experiences as well. More in class days A longer class period N/A I would improve the course by providing guided notes for the chapter readings. Stricter/clearer reading schedule might help the other students. I think all the components to the course is something that could improved. My opinion could be skewed because I took more than one History class at a time. Students seem to feel more comfortable talking when other students lead the discussion. Trying to incorporate more of that could help people speak up more in class. I can’t think of anything to improve this course I enjoyed it! My only complaint is that the class was too early in the day. I don't know The length of the chapters and number of them were a struggle N/A I believe nothing should change. It was good add something (not sure what) to grab attention of students N/A I can’t think of anything to improve this course I enjoyed it! I believe the professor did a good job and doesn't need any improvements Somehow get other students more involved Fewer padlet and chapter assignments. N/A N/A I would like to have used class time more effectively when we were actually in the class room.I think the class needs more micro projects or just one project that is presentable. This helps me see if my classmates and myself are able to use the information they learned in a real world application.\""
